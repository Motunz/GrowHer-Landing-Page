## ðŸ”§ Deployment Steps

1. **Setup a server using AWS EC2**

- Logged into my AWS account through the AWS console.
  
- Selected AWS EC2.
  
- Selected a region `eu-west-2` (London).
  
- Configured an instance:

  i. Name: Startup Prototype Server

  ii. AMI (OS): Ubuntu Server

  iii. Instance Type: t2.micro

  iv. Created and downloaded new key pair(prototype-key.pem)

  v. Network Settings: Allowed SSH(port 22), HTTP (port 40), and HTTPS (PORT 443) from anywhere.

- Launched Instance. 

2. **Connect to Server**

- Opened Local Terminal
  
- Navigated to the folder with my keypair. In my case its the Downloads folder.

```cd Downloads```

- Run:

```ssh -i "prototype-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-40-229-156.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com```

- Updated server:

```sudo apt update```

3. **Install Nginx**

- Run:

```sudo apt install nginx -y```

- Checked if nginx is running:

```sudo systemctl status nginx```

- Nginx is running. 

- Tested the nginx webserver with my EC2 public IP. It displayed the default Nginx page which confirm that my instance and nginx webserver are running fine. 

4. **Create Landing Page**

- Get into the default nginx dierectory to remove the default index.html file and create a new index.html file for my landing page:

```cd /var/www/html```

```sudo rm index.nginx-debian.html```

- Created my index.html file and added custom HTML code. 

```sudo nano index.html```

- Confirmed landing page renders via EC2 public IP .

5. **Point Domain and Secure site with Let's Encrypt SSL (Certbot)**

- Setup a free domain on Duck DNS

- Installed Certbot on my EC2

```sudo apt update -y```

```sudo apt install -y epel-release```

```sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx```

- Added a server block file and added a new config to ensure my domain http://growher.duckdns.org serve the index.html from /var/www/html.

```sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/growher```

- Enabled server block

```sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/growher /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```

- Tested and reloaded Nginx

```sudo nginx -t```

```sudo systemctl reload nginx```
